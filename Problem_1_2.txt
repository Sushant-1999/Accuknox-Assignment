Problem Statement 1: Drop TCP Packets on a Specific Port
Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed on your system. You'll need bcc (BPF Compiler Collection) and bpftool. On a Debian-based system, you can install them with:


sudo apt-get install bpfcc-tools linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt-get install bpftool

go build -o drop_tcp main.go
sudo ./drop_tcp 4040


go build -o drop_process main1.go
sudo ./drop_process myprocess 4040
